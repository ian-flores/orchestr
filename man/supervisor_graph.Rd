\title{Create a supervisor graph that routes to workers}
\usage{
supervisor_graph(supervisor, workers, max_iterations = 50L)
}
\arguments{
\item{supervisor}{An \code{Agent} object that decides routing. A system prompt
suffix and a \code{route} tool are automatically injected.}

\item{workers}{Named list of \code{Agent} objects.}

\item{max_iterations}{Integer safety cap (default 50).}
}
\value{
An \code{AgentGraph} object.
}
\description{
The supervisor agent decides which worker to invoke based on its response.
Each worker's response is fed back to the supervisor for re-evaluation.
}
\details{
The supervisor node sets \code{state$next_worker} via a routing tool that the
supervisor calls. The routing condition reads this field to dispatch to the
correct worker, or end the graph if the supervisor calls \code{route("FINISH")}.
}
