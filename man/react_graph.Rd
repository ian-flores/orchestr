react_graph(agent, tools = list(), max_iterations = 10L)
}
\arguments{
\item{agent}{An \code{Agent} object.}

\item{tools}{Named list of tool definitions to register on the agent. These
are registered via \code{agent$register_tools()} before graph compilation.}

\item{max_iterations}{Integer safety cap.}

Tool calling is handled internally by ellmer's \code{Chat} class during
\verb{$chat()}, so no separate tool dispatch node is needed.
}
