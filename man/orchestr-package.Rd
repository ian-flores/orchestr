\title{orchestr: Graph-Based Agent Orchestration}
\description{
Graph-based multi-agent workflow orchestration built on 'ellmer' for Large Language Model (LLM) chat and optional 'securer' for sandboxed code execution. Provides a fluent API for constructing agent graphs with typed state, conditional routing, human-in-the-loop interrupts, memory, and checkpointing. Convenience constructors cover common patterns: ReAct loops, sequential pipelines, and supervisor routing.
