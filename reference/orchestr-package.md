# orchestr: Graph-Based Agent Orchestration for R

Graph-based multi-agent workflow orchestration built on 'ellmer' for LLM
chat and optional 'securer' for sandboxed code execution. Provides a
fluent API for constructing agent graphs with typed state, conditional
routing, human-in-the-loop interrupts, memory, and checkpointing.
Convenience constructors cover common patterns: ReAct loops, sequential
pipelines, and supervisor routing.
